## Overview
The Orion Drift IK Rig was made by LiamDoesVR, and wolfsyncc. We did this because we thought Orion Drift could be the next Gorilla Tag in terms of YouTube, so we made a customizable model for YouTubers and other people. The rig is very simple, and easy to use, and includes badges, patterns, eyes, and color customization.

## How to use
### Opening the Rig

1. Open Blender.
2. Go to File > Open.
3. Locate and select the .blend file.
4. Click Open to load the rig.

### Posing  
1. Select the **Armature** in the **Outliner**.  
2. Switch to **Pose Mode** (shortcut: `Ctrl + Tab`).  
3. Use the IK controllers to adjust limb positions.

*This rig assumes you already know the basics of Blender. If you're unfamiliar with these steps, It's recommended that you learn Blender first.*


## Customization
Once opened and configurated, go to the "Shading" tab, and click on the Drifter. Once selected, you will see a "Drifter Shader" group on the lower side of your view. Inside that group, you can change the primary and secondary color, as well as apply badges, and textures.
